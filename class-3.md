# What is Git?

-**Snapshots**: Git is a DVCS(Distributed version control system) that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it.<br>
-**Local Operations**: Git relies on local operations because the most necessary information resides on the local disk. Eliminating the need to pull it from a server constantly.<br>
-**Tracking changes**:  Every change to a file is tracked and Git will inform what has changed and if anything has been corrupted.<br>
-**Loss of data**: Git makes it extremely difficult to accidently lose data. If it's commited your not gonna lose it.<br>
>Files in git have 3 main **states**.<br> 
>1.*Committed*: Data is securely stored in a local database.  
>2.*Modified*: Data is securely stored in a local database.  
>3.*Staged*: Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
