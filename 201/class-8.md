### FlexBox
Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  
It's designed to return the best layout for alot of different sized boxes that are trying to fit in the viewport. You can only control things on the main axis.  

Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.  
The main axis is the general direction all your elements want to move while the cross axis is the opposite direction.  

How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?  
The changes are all visual and not logical. So if the order were to be reveresed for instance a keyboard input wouldn't be.

- Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.
- Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.
- Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.
