# What Google Learned About Teams

The takeaways I had from this article are that team dynamics are always different and need to be adjusted to. It's not healthy to have a big ego and try to take control or stifle others work. Teams 
work best together when the members all get along and respect each others work and opinion. If people genuinly like working in the team they are going to output better
regardless of how brilliant each member is individually. Great culture is what makes teams and companies thrive.
