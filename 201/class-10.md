### [What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong)

**Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**   
A syntax error is usually a typo. A logic error means the code isn't written correctly and parts aren't working together as intended.  

**List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**  
Alot of errors I have run into were syntax errors from creating bad names for variables. The usual culprit is creating a variable that is just a plural version of the word.  
Also not getting the scope of variables correct in functions and global variables.  

**How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**  
It's important to learn from your mistakes. I no longer name my variables the same way and always check the scope when I am using a lot of different functions.  

### [The JavaScript Debugger.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools#the_javascript_debugger)

**How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?** 
The debugger tool allows you to see your code locally in the browser. The browser's tool can highlight specific elements and show what line is producing an error in your code to help narrow down the issue.  

**Define what a breakpoint is.**  
Places in your code that you want to pause execution and identify the problems that prevent your code from executing properly.  

**What is the call stack?**   
The Call stack section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line. You can see that the code is in the function that handles a mouse click, and that the code is currently paused on the breakpoint.
