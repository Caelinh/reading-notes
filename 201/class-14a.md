# CSS Transforms, Transitions, and Animations
### [CSS Transforms](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

**What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**  
It allows an element to be resized, repositioned and changed to a different element alltogether.The transform property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional.  

**Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**  
```
.box-1 {
  transform: rotate(20deg);
}
.box-2 {
  transform: rotate(-55deg);
}
```
Using this would cause a box element to rotate. This could really add some visual flare to a logo or on mouseover for an element. People remember this kind of interactivity.  

### [CSS Transitions & Animations](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

**What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?**  
you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.  

**How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**  
When more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states, this is where animations come in. Transition is changing the CSS property of something as long as theres a halfway point between the two properties. For example
when changing colors there are multiple shades and hues between those colors that can be transitioned through. Another example is changing sizes etc..

They really give your site a feeling of interactivety and response on top of just being very visually appealing.  
**How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?**  
I'm getting all kinds of ideas of making links around all the pages to look way nicer and give my sites a more dynamic feel. I'm not a fan of the boring static feel I've been creating thus far.
