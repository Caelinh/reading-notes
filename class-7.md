Control flow
Code is run in order from top to bottom unless there are certain conditionals and loops. Program structure affects order of execution

Functions
A function can only be used once it is called

a finches is defined by using the function keyword followed by a name, followed by parentheses. '
inside the parenthesis are the parameters you want to use inside your function. The code you want in your function will be in side of the curly braces. The parameters entered are treated as local variables.
The function will stop operating once it reaches a return statement.
functions are used to reuse code. Good for calculations and anything else you would want repeated.
If a function is called without parameters it will return the function itself and not the result of said function.
local variables can only be called inside the function that declared it. .
