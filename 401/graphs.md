## Graph terms

1. **Graph** - A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
2. **Vertex**- data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
3. **Edge** - A connection between two nodes.
4. **Neighbor** - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
5. **Degree** - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
6. **Undirected Graph** - graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional.
7. **Directed Graph** -  also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.
8. **Complete Graph** - A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
9. **Connected Graph** - has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge. A tree is a form of connected graph.
10. **Disconnected graph** - Some vertices may not have edges.
11. **Acyclic Graph** - directed graph without cycles.
12. **Cyclic Graph** - A graph that has cycles,  Which is a path of positive length that starts and ends on the same vertex.
13. **Adjacency matrix** - A two dimensional array that shows the connections between all the vertices.

15. **Adjacency List** - Most common way to represent graphs.

17. **Weighted graph** - A graph with numbers assigned to it's edges. These numbers are called weights.
