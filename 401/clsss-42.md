### [The code I'm still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e)  
This article was about a developer creating a quiz on a drug "information site" that basically advertised the drug to teenage girls instead of just informing about the drug itself.   
Later  on it was discovered that one of the major side effect of this drug was suicide and severe depression. It's scary thinking about this because the author didn't even realize 
what he was writing at the time and how it could effect a certain audience. It was a client's requirement to have this quiz and he just did it. And while he did regret it later and leave
his position, the site was prbably still up for awhile causeing damage to those teens.

### [The cybersecurity risk of self-driving cars](https://phys.org/news/2017-02-cybersecurity-self-driving-cars.html)
This article was covering the risks we face from self driving cars as they become more prevalent. As we morve to smarter cars that can drive themselves and rely more and more on the
onboard computer this opens up risks to hackers that expolit these systems. THere's a serious concern that cars could be used for terrorist attacks and really hurt their occupants
due to somne kind of cyberattack. We all know that if it has a computer it's capable of being hacked so these automakers really need to have killswitches and really good
safety features before realeasing these features to the public. It should also come down to regulators requiring a minimum level of security for the products as well.
