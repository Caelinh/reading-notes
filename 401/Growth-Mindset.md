# Growth mindset

It's important to separate the day to day things we do at work from actual growth and development. Sure when we get that new job
where everything is new we will be growing and learning but what about after we're in the mundane cycle that work may become. There will be a need to 
progress, learn, expand the mind. That can be done by creating specific challenges ofor yourself or intentionally selecting to do things that are out 
of our comfort zones. If your not uncomfortable with something can it really be said that your learning from it? 
When challenging yourself to grow it's important to set reasonable goals and to have reasonable expectations for what you want to learn. 
Once that dopamine hit comes in from hitting those small goals it makes the big picture feel a whole lot more attainable.
