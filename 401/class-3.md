# Primitives, Objects, Try/Catch



## [Primitives vs. Objects](https://www.baeldung.com/java-primitives-vs-objects)

Every primitive has an object associated with it as well. The object takes up mustch more memory than the primitive.  

**Primitive memory allocation**  
- boolean – 1 bit
- byte – 8 bits
- short, char – 16 bits
- int, float – 32 bits
- long, double – 64 bits  

**Object footprint**
- Boolean – 128 bits
- Byte – 128 bits
- Short, Character – 128 bits
- Integer, Float – 128 bits
- Long, Double – 192 bits

It's important to take things things into account when you consider what kind of platform you can expect your program to be running. Some omay require more efficiency 
with processing power/ memory allocation etc. .
