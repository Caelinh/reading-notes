# Intent filters

- intents are what allow us to have apps coommunicate with each other. Such as a share link that autmatically generates post content on another app.
- to Add intents add ````<intent-filter>```` to the manifest file.
- When detected the system identifies your intent filters and adds the information to an internal catalog of intents supported by all installed apps.
