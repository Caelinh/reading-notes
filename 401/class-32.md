# AWS Amplify

## Questions

1. What makes an API RESTful?
API's use http requests to access and use data. They send theh rest requests a nd wait for a response and handle that request accordingly.  

2. What is the benefit of using GraphQL? Any downsides?
It works hand in hand with amplify to create your database. It can be really user friendly in that regard. A problem I can see arising is that migrations would be a pain if needed to scale higher at some point.

3. Describe “serverless” to a new 301 Code Fellows student.
Serverless architecture is using the cloud and it's resources to run your application. The service provider worries about the server allocation and logcistics of running a server while the 
user only has to worry about making their application compatable with the infrastructure.
