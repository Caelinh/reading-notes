**Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**  

| SQL |	NoSQL |
|-----|-------|
| called as Relational Databases | called as non-relational database|
| table based | document based |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema |
| vertically scalable | horizontally scalable |
|good fit for the complex query intensive environment | not good fit for complex queries |
	 
**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**  
Complex data that needs to be vertically scalable.  
**Give a real world example.**  
Heavy duty transactional databases such as those used by businesses to keep track of sales.  
**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**  
hierarchical data storage.  
**Give a real world example.**  
Perhaps for keeping company records for employees or clients.  
**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**  
No SQL.  
**Which type of database is best for scalability?**  
Probably NOSQL as it's abel to be scaled using software. Sql is scaled using hardware. If money isnt an issue than that may be easier.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**  
Tables.  

**What is a ‘schema’?**  
Rules on what data can be placed in certain tables.  All the data has to follow the same rules for data entry. Such as the columns applying to all entries on a table.  

**What is a NoSQL database?**  
A database used to store a lot of data efficiently.  

**How does it work?**  
Insteead of tables it uses collections and inside of the collections are documents.  

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**  
Collections of documents. They don't have to have the same schema.  

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**  
Mongo DB because your able to add new data with different schema to the same database if you need to. No relations.  

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**  
Duplicate data that has to be updated in different collections.
