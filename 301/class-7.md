How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?  
He helped write the first web servers and published research on how the internet works the way it does.  

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  
Because these days they're designed to talk to a small group instead.  

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  
It's a process of using verbs and nouns to interact with data on the web.  

What does a GET do?  
A get sends a request to the server for some data.  

What does a POST do?  
Adds something from one system to another.  

What does PUT do?  
replaces something in another system.  

What does PATCH do?  
Partially updates a system.
