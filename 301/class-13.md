**Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?**  
Crud is manipulating the information and rest is controlling the data through http commands.  

**If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?**  
1. Read all data from database.
2. Be able to select a specific thing from the database.
3. Be able to create a new entry.
4. Create a function to update the entries in your DB.
5. HAve a function to delete entries by id in your DB.
