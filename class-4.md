**HTML Basics**

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML stands for hypertext markup language.HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way!

An element is made up of multiple parts.

The opening tag - The name of the element enclosed in angle brackets. <> This is where the element begins.

The closing tag - Determins where the specific element is closing.

content - Whats inside the element.

the element - tags and content.

>`<P> This is an example of a paragraph element </p>`

**Attributes** contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content

What's important for attributes?

1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

Nesting - Elements can be put inside of one another. 
>ex. `<p>My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.</p>`
